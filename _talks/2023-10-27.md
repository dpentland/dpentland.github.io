I talked about how cohomology of shtukas can be assembled into a sheaf on a certain stack of local systems. It is now known that this sheaf and the cohomologies can also be produced via categorical traces (in the unramified setting), which amounts to what is called the trace conjecture. Following Gaitsgory's argument, I sketch how the trace conjecture is true in a certain toy model. Notes are [here](https://dpentland.github.io/files/shtuka.pdf)
