I defined the etale and pro-etale sites of rigid analytic spaces, and explained how when the base field contains the p-adic numbers that affinoid perfectoid objects form a basis for the pro-etale topology. I then went through some propositions about condensed pro-etale cohomology needed in [this paper](https://math.bu.edu/people/jsweinst/chromatic.pdf). Notes can be found [here](https://dpentland.github.io/files/proet.pdf).
