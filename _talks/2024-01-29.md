I discussed the definition of the arc-topology on qcqs schemes, giving useful criteria for checking arc descent. I then explained arc and arc_p-descent of etale cohomology (which is what is used in the proof of the etale comparison theorem for prismatic cohomology). Notes can be found [here](https://dpentland.github.io/files/arc.pdf).
