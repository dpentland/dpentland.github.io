I gave a talk on the Beilinson fiber square, following the approach of Antieau-Mathew-Morrow-Nikolaus. I also talked on the applications of this result they give towards the p-adic variational Hodge conjecture, refining a result of Bloch-Esnault-Kerz. The notes can be found [here](https://dpentland.github.io/files/beilinson_fiber.pdf).
