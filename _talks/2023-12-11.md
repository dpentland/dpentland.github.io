I talked about the basics of adic spaces and gave a quick introduction to perfectoid spaces, closely following the approach in Scholze's thesis. I then explain some of the main ideas in Scholze's proof of Faltings' almost purity theorem. Notes can be found [here](https://dpentland.github.io/files/almost_purity.pdf).
