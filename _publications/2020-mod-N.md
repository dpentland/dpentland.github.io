collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-mod-N
excerpt: 'This paper proves a conjecture of Richard Stanley about reductions modulo N of the coefficients of q-binomial coefficients (hence the change to the less used "Gaussian Polynomials"). Namely, it shows that the residue counting function for n choose k is quasipolynomial as a corollary of a more interesting result about the decomposition of the coefficients modulo N into various periodic classes.'

This paper proves a conjecture of Richard Stanley about reductions modulo N of the coefficients of q-binomial coefficients (hence the change to the less used "Gaussian Polynomials"). It shows that the residue counting function for n choose k is quasipolynomial as a corollary of a more interesting result about the decomposition of the coefficients modulo N into various periodic classes.
